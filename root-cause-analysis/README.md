# Root Cause Analysis of Equipments

Root Cause Analysis of Equipments Using Manufacturer specs

# Lab introduction

Final product:

![synthetic image generation](/static/root-cause-analysis/demo.gif)

In this lab, we will build a simple text generator with [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) , [Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract), and Streamlit. We will upload an electric motor datasheet specs document, extract specs, pass it to Bedrock, pass sensor data and return the foundation modelâ€™s response. While this is a fairly trivial example, it allows us to understand how to build a basic generative AI prototype with very little code.

You can build the application code by copying the code snippets below and pasting into the indicated Python file.

# Use cases
Incorporating GenAI into your RCA process, you can make the analysis more adaptive, context-aware, and capable of reasoning his includes data sheets, technical manuals, and any other documentation that outlines the specifications and operational parameters is good for the following use cases:

- Understand normal operating conditions then identify deviations from specifications
- Accurate and efficient identification of root causes in electric motor issues

You can build the application code by copying the code snippets below and pasting into the indicated Python file.

This application consists of two files: one for the Streamlit front end, and one for the supporting library to make calls to Bedrock.

# Sample files
Download and save the following files to the **~/environment/genai-for-energy-manufacturing/data/root-cause-analysis** folder.
- [RS PRO 3 Phase AC motor](https://docs.rs-online.com/7939/A700000006779781.pdf)
- [AMA-IE2 90L2 2.2kW 2 Pole](https://amtecs.co.uk/datasheet/6Gq4LEgn7OAWDRKvdJ53)
- [AC motor 6W 110-120VAC](https://transmotec.com/Download/Datasheets/Transmotec-Datasheet-AI-006W.pdf)

# Run the Streamlit app
1. Select the bash terminal in AWS Cloud9 and change directory.

```
cd ~/environment/genai-for-energy-manufacturing/root-cause-analysis
```

2. Run the streamlit command from the terminal.

```
streamlit run rca_app.py --server.port 8080
```

Ignore the Network URL and External URL links displayed by the Streamlit command. Instead, we will use AWS Cloud9's preview feature.

3. In AWS Cloud9, select Preview -> Preview Running Application.

4. Try out sample sensor data and see the results.
   
5. Close the preview tab in AWS Cloud9. Return to the terminal and press Control-C to exit the application.
